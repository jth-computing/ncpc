Preparing for NWERC and ICPC at JTH
===================================

This README contains some resources
for preparing for [NWERC] and [ICPC] at [JTH]
including lists of exercises.


### Competition format

* teams of 3 university students (college / h√∂gskola / ...)
* ‚âà 10 [problems]
* 5 hours
* [solutions in: C, Python, Java, C++ or Kotlin](https://docs.icpc.global/worldfinals-programming-environment/)
* 1 computer per team
* team with most problems solved wins


### Acronyms

## Past scoreboards / past winners

* [NWERC 2022 scoreboard](https://2022.nwerc.eu/main/scoreboard/)


### [Rules]

* [regional rules]
* [NWERC rules]
* competitor's [eligibility decision tree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gt0gh7e9ubSZOr1ZpZ3liU1g0__fPzg1/view)
* First [NWERC] then [ICPC]:
  Teams first compete in the [NWERC].
  Classifying teams later participate in the [ICPC].
* [NWERC] is held yearly around November (-ish)
* [ICPC] is held yearly around May (-ish)
* [coach]: typically a faculty (lecturer)
           responsible for registering the team and being the
           point-of-contact between competitors and the contest organization
* [ICPC programming environment]
* [NWERC programming environment] -- [no internet access]
* [Allowed material]:
	- 25 physical single-sided A4 pages (Team Reference Document)
	- [some restricted digital material]
	- blank paper is also provided
	- [no internet access]

## Problems for Practicing

This section lists a few problems for practicing
taken both from [Leetcode] and [SPOJ].
[CodeForces], [HackerRank] and [Online Judge] may be useful resources too.

‚ö†Ô∏è [Leetcode] warning:
in [NCPC]/[NWERC]/[ICPC] solutions use standard I/O ---
in [Leetcode] input is already parsed.
Make sure to practice standard I/O as well ("scan" & "print").

### Traveling

Saturday, October 7th 2023, 11:00 -- 16:00 CEST (UTC+2) @ Link√∂pings Universitet

It takes 1h 45m to travel from J√∂nk√∂ping to Link√∂ping by bus.
At the contest date,
there's a bus4you leaving at 08:20 and arriving at 10:05.
It takes 30m to go from Link√∂pings station to LU,
giving us 20m to get set.

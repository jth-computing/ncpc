## Problems for Practicing

The best problems for practicing leading up to the competition
are the
[problems from NCPC 2022](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/Nordic%20Collegiate%20Programming%20Contest%20%28NCPC%29%202022?order=difficulty_data)
(last year).
Here are the easiest 5 in order of difficulty:

- [C -     Coffee Cup Combo](https://open.kattis.com/problems/coffeecupcombo)
- [D -        Disc District](https://open.kattis.com/problems/discdistrict)
- [H -         Highest Hill](https://open.kattis.com/problems/highesthill)
- [A -          Ace Arbiter](https://open.kattis.com/problems/acearbiter)
- [G - Graduation Guarantee](https://open.kattis.com/problems/graduationguarantee)

They are [available for practice at open.kattis.com](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/Nordic%20Collegiate%20Programming%20Contest%20%28NCPC%29%202022?order=difficulty_data).
You may need to edit the URL to be `open.kattis.com/problems/<PROBLEMCODE>`.

Here are the problem sets from past years:

### Practicing for NWERC

[NCPC's problems]: https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/Nordic%20Collegiate%20Programming%20Contest%20%28NCPC%29%202022?order=difficulty_category

Stick to [NCPC's problems] at first.
But if you qualify for the NWERC, take a look at the following:
[NWERC 2022];
[NWERC 2021];
[NWERC 2020];
[NWERC 2019];
[NWERC 2018];
[NWERC 2017].

A good place to start is the N easiest problems from the (N+1) previous years for N = {1, 2, 3, ...}.  For N=1:

* [2022 B - Bottle Flip](https://open.kattis.com/problems/bottleflip)
* [2021 K - Knitpicking](https://open.kattis.com/problems/knitpicking)

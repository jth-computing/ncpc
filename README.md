Preparing for NWERC and ICPC at JTH
===================================

This README contains some resources
for preparing for [NWERC] and [ICPC] at [JTH]
including lists of [problems and exercises](#problems-for-practicing).


### [Competition format]

* üë• teams of 3 university students (college / h√∂gskola / ...)
* üö© ‚âà 10 [problems]
* ‚è±Ô∏è 5 hours
* ‚å®Ô∏è [solutions in: C, Python, Java, C++ or Kotlin](https://docs.icpc.global/worldfinals-programming-environment/)
* üíª 1 computer per team
* üéà team with most problems solved wins


### Acronyms

* [NWERC]: The Northwestern Europe Regional Contest, a.k.a. "regional"
* [ICPC]: International Collegiate Programming Contest, a.k.a. "World Finals"


## Problems for Practicing

Taken both from [Leetcode] and [SPOJ].
[CodeForces], [HackerRank] and [Online Judge] may be useful resources too.

‚ö†Ô∏è [Leetcode] warning:
in [NWERC]/[ICPC] solutions use standard I/O ---
in [Leetcode] input is already parsed.
Make sure to practice standard I/O as well ("scan" & "print").
